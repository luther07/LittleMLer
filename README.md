## *The Little MLer* is an awesome book, and I want to master it.
##### I'm going to store my files in this repo as I work through the book.
##### I'm using Objective Caml, because this language is used in industry.
##### I don't believe that SML (Standard ML) is used outside academia.
##### Right now I'm loading the files into the top-level interpreter.
##### The book doesn't provide the definitions and functions in OCaml.
##### Instead the book uses SML, providing some hints to translate to OCaml.
##### Use 'git pull origin master' command to get repo updates.
