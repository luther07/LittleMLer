* "The Little MLer" is an awesome book, and I want to master it.
* I'm going to store my files in this repo as I work through the book.
* I'm using Objective Caml, because this language is used in industry 
* I don't believe that SML (Standard ML) is used outside academia.
* Right now I'm loading the files into the top-level interpreter.
